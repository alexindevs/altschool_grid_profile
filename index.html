                My name is <strong>Esther Ohiomame</strong>. I'm a software engineer who lives at the intersection of AI, DevOps, and backend systems. I enjoy turning messy requirements into clean, reliable services and shipping fast without breaking things. I juggle multiple projects, document obsessively, and keep learning (hello, CS degree and cloud diploma grind). Outside code, I value autonomy, clear communication, and building tools that actually help people do real work. If something can be automated, I'm the person asking “why isn't it already?”

                  <strong>Hobbies:</strong> 
                  I love reading and getting lost in new stories or ideas. 
                  I also enjoy visiting new spots, whether it's a quiet café or a lively market, because each place has its own rhythm. 
                  Swimming (or just being around bodies of water)helps me reset and think clearly. 
                  And on top of that, I cook for fun, experimenting with flavors as a creative outlet.

                  <strong>Aspiration in life:</strong> 
                  Build durable, user-respecting software that outlives hype: a profitable SaaS that automates infra and ops for small teams, then reinvest the wins into teaching and mentoring new engineers. 
                  I also want to contribute to things that matter deeply to me, like supporting scientific research, funding mental health projects, and backing initiatives that push society forward in meaningful ways.
